## üîÑ Complete Payment Flow Routes

### Step-by-Step Route Flow

```
1. User visits: /generate-kundli
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Controller: frontend/Appointment
       ‚îî‚îÄ> View: frontend/appointment.php

2. User submits form (AJAX POST)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Route: /payment/generateKundli
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Controller: Payment->initiate_payment()
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Internal call to: /phonepe/create_payment
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Returns PhonePe checkout URL

3. User redirected to PhonePe (external)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> User completes payment on PhonePe platform

4. PhonePe redirects back (SUCCESS)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Route: /payment/payment_confirmation?orderId=XXX
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Controller: Payment->payment_confirmation()
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Verifies payment with /phonepe/order_status
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Creates/logs in user account
           ‚îú‚îÄ> Generates kundli
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Redirects to: /dashboard/kundli/{kundli_id}

5. User views generated kundli
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Route: /dashboard/kundli/{id}
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Controller: Dashboard->view_kundli($id)
           ‚îî‚îÄ> View: frontend/dashboard/view_kundli.php

Alternative flows:
- Payment cancelled: /payment/payment_cancel?orderId=XXX
- Payment failed: /payment/payment_failure?orderId=XXX
```

## üîç Route Configuration Analysis

### Routes File Location
`/workspace/application/config/routes.php`

### Route Patterns

#### Simple Routes
```php
$route['generate-kundli'] = 'frontend/appointment';
// URL: /generate-kundli
// Maps to: application/controllers/frontend/Appointment.php
```

#### Routes with Parameters
```php
$route['dashboard/kundli/(:num)'] = 'dashboard/view_kundli/$1';
// URL: /dashboard/kundli/123
// Maps to: Dashboard->view_kundli(123)
// Parameter: (:num) = numeric ID only
```

#### Multiple Aliases
```php
$route['payment/generateKundli'] = 'payment/initiate_payment';
$route['payment/initiate_payment'] = 'payment/initiate_payment';
// Both URLs work, pointing to same controller method
```

## üêõ Common Route Issues (RESOLVED)

### Issue 1: Dashboard Redirect After Payment ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Was redirecting to `/dashboard/view_kundli/{id}` which didn't match route
**Solution:** Changed to `/dashboard/kundli/{id}` which matches route configuration
**File:** `application/controllers/Payment.php` (Line 247)

### Issue 2: Payment Verification Missing ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Not verifying payment before creating account
**Solution:** Added PhonePe API status check
**File:** `application/controllers/Payment.php` (Lines 134-167)

### Issue 3: User Account Duplicates ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Creating new account even if user exists
**Solution:** Added phone-based user lookup
**File:** `application/controllers/Payment.php` (Lines 172-219)

## üìù Route Naming Conventions

### URL Structure
- Frontend pages: kebab-case (`/generate-kundli`)
- Dashboard pages: prefix with `/dashboard`
- API endpoints: prefix with `/payment` or `/phonepe`
- Authentication: prefix with `/auth` (with aliases)

### Controller Structure
- Frontend controllers: `application/controllers/frontend/`
- Backend controllers: `application/controllers/`
- Admin controllers: `application/controllers/admin/`

### Method Naming
- Use underscores: `payment_confirmation` not `paymentConfirmation`
- Be descriptive: `view_kundli` not `view`
- Match route purpose: `initiate_payment` for payment start

## üîí Protected Routes

### Routes Requiring Login
```php
// Dashboard routes (checked in Dashboard controller __construct)
/dashboard
/dashboard/profile
/dashboard/kundli/{id}
/dashboard/download_pdf/{id}
```

### Public Routes
```php
// No login required
/
/about-us
