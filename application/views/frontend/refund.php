This policy explains our payment process, refund eligibility, cancellation terms, delivery timeline, and what to do in case of non-delivery. By using our services, you agree to the terms outlined below.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">1. Nature of Our Services</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">We provide digital astrology-based services such as personalized kundli reports, horoscope analysis, and Vedic astrology-based predictions. These are delivered in PDF format via email based on your birth details (date, time, place of birth, name, gender, etc.). Each report is uniquely generated using manual and/or system-driven astrological analysis and is non-transferable.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">2. Pricing and Service Tiers</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">Our services are priced between ₹100 to ₹1500 based on the report complexity. Each service page clearly outlines the features and price. Promotional discounts or price revisions may occur, but the price at checkout is considered final.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">3. Payment Methods</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">Payments can be made securely through our trusted third-party gateways. We support UPI, debit/credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), net banking, wallets, and other secure payment modes. All transactions are SSL encrypted and PCI-compliant. KundliMagic.com does not store any payment data such as card numbers or CVV codes.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">4. Confirmation of Order</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">Upon successful payment, you will receive an order confirmation email with your order number and service details. If not received within a few minutes, check your spam folder or contact us at <a href="mailto:help@kundlimagic.com">help@kundlimagic.com</a> with your transaction reference.</p>

                    <p class="as_font14">Reports are typically delivered within 24 to 72 hours via email in PDF format. We do not provide printed reports. Delays caused by incomplete or incorrect input data are not our responsibility. We may reach out to you for clarification if necessary.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">6. Refund Policy</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">Due to the personalized and digital nature of our services, refunds are not possible once an order is processed. This includes cases of incorrect details submitted by users or dissatisfaction with the content of the report. Each report involves time, analysis, and effort that cannot be reused.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">7. Exceptions – Non-Delivery</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">If you do not receive your report after a successful payment, please contact <a href="mailto:help@kundlimagic.com">help@kundlimagic.com</a>. After verifying your transaction, we will ensure prompt delivery of your report. This exception applies only to non-delivery, not dissatisfaction.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">8. Cancellations</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">Orders cannot be canceled once placed. If you notice an error in the details you submitted, contact us immediately. If your order is not yet processed, we may be able to update the data. Once processed, no edits or cancellations are allowed.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">9. Failed Transactions</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">If your transaction fails but funds are debited, please wait 24-48 hours for the payment gateway to auto-refund. If the refund is not processed, contact your bank or email us with your transaction details and screenshot for assistance. Refunds for failed transactions are handled by the gateway provider.</p>

                    <h5 class="as_orange as_subheading as_padderTop10 as_padderBottom10">10. Currency</h5>
                    <p class="as_font14">All charges on our website are listed in Indian Rupees (INR). International users may see equivalent values, but payment will be processed in INR based on the prevailing exchange rate at the time of transaction.</p>
