## 🎯 FILEZILLA UPLOAD STEPS

### Step 1: Get Your FTP Details

You need these from your hosting provider:

```
FTP Host: ___________________________ (e.g., ftp.yourdomain.com or IP)
FTP Username: _______________________ 
FTP Password: _______________________
FTP Port: 21 (Standard FTP) or 22 (SFTP)
```

**Don't have these?** 
- Check your hosting control panel (cPanel)
- Look for "FTP Accounts" or "FTP Details"
- Or contact your hosting support

---

### Step 2: Open FileZilla and Connect

1. **Open FileZilla Client**

2. **Enter Connection Details** (Top Bar):
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Host: ftp.yourdomain.com                    │
   │ Username: your_ftp_username                 │
   │ Password: your_ftp_password                 │
   │ Port: 21                                    │
   │           [Quickconnect]                    │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

3. **Click [Quickconnect]**

4. **Trust Certificate** (if SFTP):
   - If popup appears, click "OK" or "Always trust this host"

---

### Step 3: Navigate to Document Root

**On the RIGHT panel (Remote Site - Server):**

Find your document root folder. It's usually ONE of these:
- `public_html/`
- `www/`
- `httpdocs/`
- `html/`
- `public/`

**Double-click to open it**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you're INSIDE this folder, not outside!

```
Correct Path:
└── public_html/  ← You should see this path at top
    └── (upload files here)      
Wrong Path:
└── / (root)
    └── public_html/  ← Don't upload here!
```

---

### Step 4: Navigate to Your Local Folder

**On the LEFT panel (Local Site - Your Computer):**

1. Navigate to:
   ```
   /Users/sarthakbansal/Downloads/kundali-magic-main/
   ```

2. You should see these folders/files:
   ```
   📁 admin/
   📁 application/
   📁 assets/
   📁 css/
   📁 database/
   📁 system/
   📁 uploads/
   📄 .htaccess
   📄 index.php
   📄 studokch_astro.sql
   ```

---

### Step 5: Upload EVERYTHING

#### Method 1: Select All and Upload (RECOMMENDED)

1. **In LEFT panel**, press `Ctrl+A` (Windows) or `Cmd+A` (Mac)
   - This selects ALL files and folders

2. **Right-click** on the selection → Choose **"Upload"**

3. **Wait** for upload to complete (~10-15 minutes)

#### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. **Select all files/folders** in LEFT panel
2. **Drag** them to the RIGHT panel (public_html/)
3. **Drop** and wait for upload

---

### Step 6: Monitor Upload Progress

**Bottom Panel - Transfer Queue:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Transfer Queue:
[=================>              ] 45%
Status: Uploading assets/images/logo.svg
Speed: 2.5 MB/s
Time remaining: 5 minutes

Files: 2,350 / 5,000
Size: 18 MB / 40 MB

✅ Completed: index.php
✅ Completed: .htaccess
✅ Completed: application/config/config.php
⏳ Transferring: assets/css/style.css
⏳ Queued: system/core/CodeIgniter.php
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Wait until:**
- Progress bar shows 100%
- Queue shows "0 files remaining"
- All transfers show ✅

---

### Step 7: Verify Upload (IMPORTANT!)

**Check the RIGHT panel (Server):**

You should see ALL these folders:
```
✅ admin/
✅ application/
✅ assets/
✅ css/
✅ database/
✅ system/
✅ uploads/
✅ .htaccess
✅ index.php
✅ composer.json
✅ studokch_astro.sql
```

**Missing folders?** 
- Check if upload finished completely
- Check for error messages in bottom panel
- Try uploading missing folders again

---

### Step 8: Set Folder Permissions (CRITICAL!)

These folders need write permissions:

#### Via FileZilla:

1. **Right-click** on folder → **File permissions...**

2. Set permissions for each folder:

**application/cache/**
```
Numeric value: 755 (or 777 if 755 doesn't work)
☑ Recurse into subdirectories
☑ Apply to directories only
Click [OK]
```

**application/logs/**
```
Numeric value: 755 (or 777)
☑ Recurse into subdirectories
Click [OK]
```

**application/sessions/**
```
Numeric value: 755 (or 777)
☑ Recurse into subdirectories
Click [OK]
```

**uploads/kundlis/**
```
Numeric value: 755 (or 777)
☑ Recurse into subdirectories
Click [OK]
```

#### Permission Numbers Explained:
- **755** = Owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute (RECOMMENDED)
- **777** = Everyone can read/write/execute (use if 755 doesn't work)

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE IS ALREADY SET UP!

Good news! You've already imported the database and configured credentials.

### Your Database Details:
```
Database Name: studokch_astro
Database User: studokch_astro
Database Password: @Navneet123N
Database Host: localhost
```

✅ **These credentials are already configured** in:
- `application/config/database.php`

---

## ⚙️ UPDATE BASE URL (IMPORTANT!)

After upload, you need to update one more file:

### Via FileZilla:

1. **Navigate** to: `public_html/application/config/`

2. **Find** `config.php`

3. **Right-click** → **View/Edit**

4. **Find this line** (around line 26):
   ```php
   $config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:8000/';
   ```

5. **Change to your domain:**
   ```php
   $config['base_url'] = 'https://yourdomain.com/';
   ```
   
   **Examples:**
   - `https://kundalimagic.com/`
   - `https://www.kundalimagic.com/`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/kundali/` (if in subfolder)

6. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

7. **FileZilla will ask:** "File has changed. Upload?"
   - Click **[Yes]**

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: White Screen / Blank Page

**Solution:**
1. Set folder permissions to 777:
   - application/cache/
   - application/logs/
   - application/sessions/

2. Check if `.htaccess` uploaded correctly

3. View error logs:
   - Download `application/logs/` folder
   - Check for error files

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error

**Solution:**
1. Check `.htaccess` syntax
2. Verify PHP version is 7.4+ (check cPanel)
3. Check file permissions (755 or 777)
4. View server error logs in cPanel

### Issue: CSS/Images Not Loading

**Solution:**
1. Check `base_url` in `config.php` ends with `/`
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check if `assets/` folder uploaded correctly
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Solution:**
Your credentials are already set correctly:
```php
'hostname' => 'localhost',
'username' => 'studokch_astro',
'password' => '@Navneet123N',
'database' => 'studokch_astro',
```

If still error:
1. Verify database exists in phpMyAdmin
2. Verify user has ALL PRIVILEGES
3. Check if password has special characters (it does: `@`)
4. Test database connection in phpMyAdmin

### Issue: 404 Error on Pages

**Solution:**
1. Check if `.htaccess` exists in root
2. Check if mod_rewrite is enabled (ask hosting)
3. Update `config.php`:
   ```php
   $config['index_page'] = '';  // Should be empty
   ```

---

## 🔒 ENABLE HTTPS/SSL (IMPORTANT!)

### In cPanel:

1. Go to **SSL/TLS Status**

2. Install **Let's Encrypt SSL** (Free)

3. **Enable** SSL for your domain

4. **Update** `.htaccess` to force HTTPS:
   - Via FileZilla, edit `.htaccess`
   - Uncomment these lines at bottom:
     ```apache
     RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
     ```
