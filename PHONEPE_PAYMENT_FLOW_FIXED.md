# PhonePe Payment Integration - Fixed Flow

## Summary
Fixed the PhonePe payment integration for kundli generation with automatic account creation and dashboard redirect.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **User Model - Phone Field Handling** (`application/models/User_model.php`)
- **Issue**: The `create_user_from_kundli()` method was looking for `ph_no` field, but the form sends `phone`
- **Fix**: Updated method to handle both `phone` and `ph_no` fields for backward compatibility
- **Change**: Modified the phone/whatsapp field detection logic to prioritize `phone` field

### 2. **Payment Controller - User Account Creation** (`application/controllers/Payment.php`)
- **Issue**: Wasn't checking if a user already exists before creating a new account
- **Fix**: Added logic to check for existing user by phone number before creating new account
  - If user exists: Auto-login the existing user
  - If user doesn't exist: Create new account and auto-login
- **Improvement**: Added proper null handling for optional email field

### 3. **Payment Controller - Payment Verification** (`application/controllers/Payment.php`)
- **Critical Issue**: Payment confirmation was not verifying if payment was actually successful!
- **Fix**: Added payment verification step that calls PhonePe order_status API before creating account/kundli
- **Security**: Only proceeds with account creation and kundli generation if payment is confirmed as successful
- **Error Handling**: Redirects back to form with error message if payment verification fails

### 4. **Dashboard Route** (`application/controllers/Payment.php`)
- **Issue**: Redirect URL didn't match the route configuration
- **Fix**: Changed redirect from `dashboard/view_kundli/` to `dashboard/kundli/` to match routes.php

## Complete Payment Flow

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User Fills Form** (`/generate-kundli`)
   - User enters: name, phone, email (optional), gender, DOB, TOB, place of birth, language, kundli type
   - Clicks "Generate Kundli" button

2. **AJAX Request to Payment Controller**
   - Form data is sent to `payment/generateKundli` (routes to `payment/initiate_payment`)
   - Controller validates required fields
   - Stores form data and order ID in session
   - Sets amount based on kundli type (â‚¹51 for basic, â‚¹101 for detailed)

3. **PhonePe Payment Initiation**
   - Payment controller calls PhonePe API to create payment order
   - PhonePe returns checkout URL
   - User is redirected to PhonePe payment page

4. **User Completes Payment**
   - User pays on PhonePe platform
   - PhonePe redirects back to: `payment/payment_confirmation?orderId=XXX`

5. **Payment Confirmation & Verification** âœ¨ NEW
   - Validates order ID matches stored session
   - **Verifies payment status with PhonePe API**
   - Only proceeds if payment is successful

6. **Automatic Account Creation** âœ¨ NEW
   - Checks if user is already logged in
   - If not, checks if account exists by phone number
     - **Existing user**: Auto-login
     - **New user**: Create account with random password, then auto-login
   - Sets session data (user_id, user_name, user_email, logged_in)

7. **Kundli Generation**
   - Saves kundli data to database linked to user account
   - Includes: user_id, name, birth details, kundli preferences

8. **Redirect to Dashboard** âœ¨ FIXED
   - Clears temporary session data (form data, order ID)
   - Redirects to `dashboard/kundli/{kundli_id}` to view generated kundli

## File Changes Made

1. `/workspace/application/models/User_model.php`
   - Modified `create_user_from_kundli()` method

2. `/workspace/application/controllers/Payment.php`
   - Enhanced `payment_confirmation()` method with:
     - Payment verification
     - Existing user check
     - Proper error handling
     - Correct redirect path

## Testing the Flow

To test the complete flow:

1. Go to `/generate-kundli`
2. Fill in the form (or use the "Fill Form with Test Data" button)
3. Click "Generate Kundli"
4. Complete payment on PhonePe (test mode)
5. Should redirect to dashboard showing the generated kundli
6. User account should be auto-created (check MongoDB users collection)
7. Try generating another kundli with same phone - should use existing account

## Security Improvements

1. âœ… Payment verification before processing
2. âœ… Session validation (order ID check)
3. âœ… Proper error messages without exposing sensitive data
4. âœ… Automatic user detection prevents duplicate accounts

## Routes Configured

All routes are properly configured in `application/config/routes.php`:

```php
// Payment routes
$route['payment/generateKundli'] = 'payment/initiate_payment';
$route['payment/payment_confirmation'] = 'payment/payment_confirmation';
$route['payment/payment_cancel'] = 'payment/payment_cancel';
$route['payment/payment_failure'] = 'payment/payment_failure';

// Dashboard routes
$route['dashboard'] = 'dashboard';
$route['dashboard/kundli/(:num)'] = 'dashboard/view_kundli/$1';

// Kundli generation
$route['generate-kundli'] = 'frontend/appointment';
```

## What Users Will Experience

1. ðŸŽ¯ Click "Generate Kundli" â†’ Redirects to PhonePe payment
2. ðŸ’³ Complete payment on PhonePe
3. âœ¨ Automatically creates account (or logs into existing account)
4. ðŸŽ¨ Redirects to beautiful dashboard showing generated kundli
5. ðŸ“± Can view kundli details, download PDF (if available)
6. ðŸ”„ Can generate more kundlis - all saved under same account

## Notes

- First-time users get auto-created account with random secure password
- Returning users (same phone) automatically use existing account
- Email is optional - phone number is the primary identifier
- All kundlis are linked to user account for future access
- Dashboard shows all user's kundlis with generation dates
